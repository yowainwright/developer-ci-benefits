## About the Speaker

This talk was written by [Jeff Wainwright](https://github.com/yowainwright) - an average Joe developer working at Dollar Shave Club. Since Learning more about CI, he's used it to create and maintain several open-source projects and work with the Dollar Shave Club Engineering Team to speed up CI/CD. This work has given him more time to improve as an engineer, build, and have more life outside of software. He would love help build more utilities to improve CI and non-code-related parts of repositories.
