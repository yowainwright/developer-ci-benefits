# CI Benefits

The main reason for a talk about CI is because of how much it helps developer growth. There is a lot of content on how to improve as a developer.
Most of the content is great! However, no matter how much developers want to work on improving skills or learning, time can be a blocker or an enabler to goals.
It is common to read about [quick keys](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf) or tools like [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) for speeding up workflow but CI might be the largest enabler of time savings.
