# CI Configuration Init

Getting CI started for a repository takes minutes or even less! This document will focus on getting set up quickly. More details will be provided in later documents.

---

> Travis and Circle work very similarly. For this talk, CircleCI will be used for documentation.

---

## Starting Integration

Once code is unit tested and the developer is confident enough to submit a pull request or merge their code into a master (shared) branch, there are more safety checks to assist them in submitting code.

---

> The sentence above assumes that [git](https://git-scm.com/) is being used. Code can be submitted via alternate patterns like FTP or saving within a CMS. In those scenarios, unit tests and the integrations below can still be used.

---


There are common scripts that are run in CI like safety checks, unit tests, acceptance tests, and code quality checks. Review [Talk Objectives](01-talk-objectives.md) for more reference.

## Automatic Setup

CI can be setup automatically for both CircleCI and Travis! If a valid `test` command is already defined in the repository's `package.json`, CI can be implemented without any more configuration.

In a CI tool, like [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) or [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), the repository can be searched for after logging in or being authenticated. From there, follow the CI tool's UI to start testing.

For JavaScript, CircleCI will look at `test` within a repository's `package.json` to see if a valid test script is added. If it is, then CircleCI will begin running CI automatically. Read more about setting up CircleCI automatically [here](https://circleci.com/docs/enterprise/quick-start/).

## Setting up CI Configuration

If tests aren't yet written, or if a more configured setup is needed, a configuration `.yml` file can be added for a CI tool (like CircleCI) to execute runner scripts from.

Demonstrated below is how to set up a custom CircleCI configuration with JavaScript linting (ESlint) for a CircleCI.

1. Set up linting.
   - npm install eslint --save-dev
   - within `package.json` add an eslint script, for example, `"eslint:ci": "eslint ."`
1. Set up a CI configuration file
   - within a shell run `mkdir .circleci && touch .circleci/config.yml`
   - Add the following to the file:

     ```yml

      defaults: &defaults
        working_directory: ~/code
        docker:
          - image: circleci/node:10
            environment:
              NPM_CONFIG_LOGLEVEL: error # make npm commands less noisy
              JOBS: max # https://gist.github.com/ralphtheninja/f7c45bdee00784b41fed
      version: 2
      jobs:
        build:
          <<: *defaults
          steps:
            - checkout
            - run: npm i
            - run: npm run eslint:ci

     ```

After the steps above are completed and after CircleCI has been configured in Github (read about that [here](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/), CircleCI will pick up the `.circleci/config.yml` and lint JavaScript in a CI process when a pull request is submitted.

View the [examples](examples/) folder of this repository to get ideas for configuring CI with config `.yml` files.

## Why is setting up even basic CI so important?

Setting up CI even with the most basic setup is beneficial for time-saving and code quality!

Two features that can save developers hours per week with simple CI are automatic dependency updates and **build testing**[1]. Dependency updates will be discussed more [here](12-dependency-updates.md).

---

> [1] Build testing means when `node_modules` are installed during CI by running an install, `npm install` for example, all `node_modules` install as expected. This is a simple task and **does** fail. Ensuring that `node_modules` install as expected and saves considerable time for developers!
