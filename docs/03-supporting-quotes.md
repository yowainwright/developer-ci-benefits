# Supporting Quotes

CI is development process pattern that is so mandatory that it is undiscussed by developers that practice it. It is undiscussed by developers that don't practice it for the exact opposite reasons.

> Testing is one of these things that people don't talk about it a lot because people don't do it. ...People that do do testing are extremely passionate about it—like crossfit. ...I have a feeling a lot of people don't test.

_Paraphrasing [Wes Bos](wesbos.com) from the [Syntax](syntax.fm) podcast on [test](https://syntax.fm/show/040/the-testing-show)_

This quote was chosen because before starting at Dollar Shave Club, I had worked on some decent sized engineering teams and had never written a unit test—so I get it.

> Releasing software is too often an art; it should be an engineering discipline.

_[David Farley](http://www.davefarley.net/), [Continuous Delivery](https://martinfowler.com/books/continuousDelivery.html)_

This quote was chosen because it breaks down what can seem mythical into a process that any person can follow and safely **try** to ship code.
