# Running Tests and Safety Checks

Running Tests within CI is done via a `.yml` file whether [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) or [CircleCi](https://circleci.com/) is being used. To get up and running, CI checks do not require much.

---

> Travis and Circle work very similarly. For this talk, CircleCi will be used for documentation.

## A brief introduction into running tests and safety checks

Most tests and safety checks are run via runner scripts, shell commands, or CLI tools (see the **runner scripts** description in [talk objectives](01-talk-objectives.md)). Shell commands are commands run in an application like [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(macOS)), [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/), or [Hyper](https://hyper.is/). Shell commands communicate directly to a computer, telling it what do to. For CI purposes, these commands mainly relate to reading files and providing information about the files to us.

### Making Sense of Running Tests and Safety Checks

A human can do all of the things CI Tests and Safety Checks do. A human can try changing code in an application to see if it works, review spelling, and look over code quality. All of **that** review takes a long time and is prone to human error. Apps can be used to run tests and safety checks but starting apps manually and using an app's interface takes a lot of time too.

On the contrary to human review and manual app review, running tests and safety commands via a shell can use apps and tools without human involvement to achieve the same results but better. Plus, running commands can be done repeatedly within a short time frame and at an automated time frame. More information about running commands at an automated time frame will be described in a later document.

## Running Test and Checks Examples

Listed below are visual runner script command examples.

**Remove `node_modules` and re-install them**

```sh
rm -rf node_modules
yarn
```

The command above will remove the `node_modules` directory with a shell command and then re-install them with a CLI tool command.

**Run a shell script**

````sh
./some-shell-command.sh

```

The `./` invokes the command and runs the script located within the file `some-shell-command.sh`.

**Run tests**

```sh

jest
````

```
[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is a testing tool with a command line interface (CLI). A CLI abstracts running commands to make it more specific to what is being done.

**Linting JavaScript**

```sh
eslint --fix
```

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is another tool. ESLint is used in reviewing quality of JavaScript code. ESLint also provides a CLI. The command above runs ESLint. The `--fix` is an optional argument of ESLint's CLI. It fixes all issues it can without any developer changes required.

## Useful Commands to Add to Workflows

The runner scripts below are presented for quick review and use to incorporate CI.

### Create automatic CHANGELOG.md updates

Render/Update a `CHANGELOG.md` during release

```sh
yarn add conventional-changelog-cli -D
```

Incorporating automatic `CHANGELOG.md` updates

```json
"chore:changelog": "conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -s -r 0",
"chore:pr": "git add . && git commit -m '[chore] updates changelog' --no-verify && git push origin chore-changelog -f",
"chore": "npm run chore:delete-branch && npm run chore:branch && npm run chore:changelog && npm run chore:pr",
"postpublish": "git tag $npm_package_version && git push origin --tags && npm run chore",
```

### Linting

Linting can be done for most things having to do with code. The example below provides linting opportunities for JavaScript and Markdown.

```sh
yarn add eslint markdownlint-cli -D
```

```json
"markdownlint": "markdownlint *.md",
"eslint": "eslint . --fix",
"eslint:ci": "eslint .",
```

### Fix Spelling in Markdown

Runner scripts fix spelling. The example below provides spell-checking for feature-rich spell-checking and spell-checking for CI.

```sh
yarn add markdown-spellcheck -D
```

```json
"spelling": "mdspell '**/*.md' '!**/node_modules/**/*.md' --ignore-numbers",
"spelling:ci": "mdspell '**/*.md' '!**/node_modules/**/*.md' --ignore-numbers --report",
```

### Control Gitflow

Controlling git can control the way updates are presented within a repository.

```sh
yarn add husky -D
```

```json
"prepush": "npm test",
```

### Work on a repository grammar

Checking and fixing grammar on the fly can help ensure grammar remains (or becomes) readable.

```sh
yarn add write-good -D
```

```json
"grammar": "write-good *.md --no-passive",
```
